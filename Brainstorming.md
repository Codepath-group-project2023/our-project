## Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas
## Top three ideas:
### Evaluating idea 1: Covid Tracker
**Mobile:** can easily and quickly check covid stats in real time rather than having to access a computer like a macbook pro from 2017
**Story:** this app can be resourceful to many as covid is still spreading today which is tragic
**Market:** potential user base could be for those that are traveling to another country as they can track the rates in that country and stay safe because duh
**Habit:** once in a while like 
**Scope:** difficulty 5/10? most of the information would be coming from the API so the main build would be allowing user search to search stuff
### Evaluating idea 2: Recipe Finder
**Mobile:** Rather than going through different websites to find a recipe for biriyani, you can find whatever you need in one app
**Story:** This app would allow chefs like gordon ramsay with different expertice to try and cook new recipes. It would also allow users to track their salt intake, sugar intake, carbs, etc. 
**Market:** Potential users for this app can be me, you, Gordon Ramsay and anyone looking to expand their palate
**Habit:** The app could encourage users such as Paulina Ramos to browse and search for recipes on a daily basis, as well as plan their meals for the week and create a shopping list. 
**Scope:** Difficulty 7/10 because the app would require a database of recipes, as well as a way for users to search and maybe filter them based on ingredients, cooking time, and/or dietary restrictions. The scope would increase further if the app included user-generated content, such as allowing users to upload their own recipes or rate and review existing ones.
### Evaluating idea 3: Movie Finder
**Mobile:** App would be essential to provide an easy-to-use interface for users to browse and search for movies, view movie details, and save their favorite movies like home alone 2 lost in new york perhaps? 
**Story:** The app would allow movie enthusiasts to easily search for and discover new movies, view movie details such as the cast, synopsis, and ratings, and share their favorite movies or shows they are currently watching like ginny & georgia with their friends on social media platforms.
**Market:** This app would appeal to anyone who loves movies, like casual moviegoers who love spiderman no way home or avid film enthusiasts.
**Habit:** The app could encourage users to browse and search for movies on a daily basis, as well as track the movies they've watched and add them to their watchlist for future viewing like blacklist
**Scope:** The initial version of the app could focus on providing a simple and intuitive interface for browsing and searching for movies and shows like how I met your mom, as well as displaying basic movie details. Future versions could expand the scope to include features such as personalized recommendations and movie ratings
