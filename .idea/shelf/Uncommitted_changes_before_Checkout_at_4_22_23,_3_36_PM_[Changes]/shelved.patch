+# Brainstorming
+### Activity 1: Brainstorm Ideas
+## Step 1: Generate New Ideas
+
+### Lubna's 3 app ideas
+1) Covid-19 tracker (Health)
+    - allows users to track corona virus cases and death tolls in different countries/states 
+2) Recipe finder (Lifestyle)
+     - allows users to look up different recipes and learn the ingredients required and the different nutrients it provides
+3) Movie finder (Entertainment)
+     - allows users to look up different movies and to view the cast, a description, etc
+### Gael's 3 app ideas
+1) app that allows user to plan out a trip and add links, pictures, notes, to do lists
+2) User provides the app with favorite kinds of exercise and it will give a daily list of activties to do
+3) translation app 
+### Cara's 3 app ideas
+1) Class schedule app
+    - lets the user enter in their classes and the time it is at 
+    - display a schedule(like schedule builder)
+    - don't know what api to use though
+2) Dictionary app/api(?) https://dictionaryapi.dev/
+3) Restaurant finder app
+### Kazi's 3 app ideas
+1) Hehe haha jokes using https://api.chucknorris.io/
+2) Current weather data for a given location using https://openweathermap.org/api
+3) list of top news headlines from various news sources using https://newsapi.org/
+
+## Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas
+## Top three ideas:
+### Evaluating idea 1: Covid Tracker
+**Mobile:** can easily and quickly check covid stats in real time rather than having to access a computer like a macbook pro from 2017
+**Story:** this app can be resourceful to many as covid is still spreading today which is tragic
+**Market:** potential user base could be for those that are traveling to another country as they can track the rates in that country and stay safe because duh
+**Habit:** once in a while like 
+**Scope:** difficulty 5/10? most of the information would be coming from the API so the main build would be allowing user search to search stuff
+### Evaluating idea 2: Recipe Finder
+**Mobile:** Rather than going through different websites to find a recipe for biriyani, you can find whatever you need in one app
+**Story:** This app would allow chefs like gordon ramsay with different expertice to try and cook new recipes. It would also allow users to track their salt intake, sugar intake, carbs, etc. 
+**Market:** Potential users for this app can be me, you, Gordon Ramsay and anyone looking to expand their palate
+**Habit:** The app could encourage users such as Paulina Ramos to browse and search for recipes on a daily basis, as well as plan their meals for the week and create a shopping list. 
+**Scope:** Difficulty 7/10 because the app would require a database of recipes, as well as a way for users to search and maybe filter them based on ingredients, cooking time, and/or dietary restrictions. The scope would increase further if the app included user-generated content, such as allowing users to upload their own recipes or rate and review existing ones.
+### Evaluating idea 3: Movie Finder
+**Mobile:** App would be essential to provide an easy-to-use interface for users to browse and search for movies, view movie details, and save their favorite movies like home alone 2 lost in new york perhaps? 
+**Story:** The app would allow movie enthusiasts to easily search for and discover new movies, view movie details such as the cast, synopsis, and ratings, and share their favorite movies or shows they are currently watching like ginny & georgia with their friends on social media platforms.
+**Market:** This app would appeal to anyone who loves movies, like casual moviegoers who love spiderman no way home or avid film enthusiasts.
+**Habit:** The app could encourage users to browse and search for movies on a daily basis, as well as track the movies they've watched and add them to their watchlist for future viewing like blacklist
+**Scope:** The initial version of the app could focus on providing a simple and intuitive interface for browsing and searching for movies and shows like how I met your mom, as well as displaying basic movie details. Future versions could expand the scope to include features such as personalized recommendations and movie ratings
+

+
+## App Overview
+### Description 
+The app will allow users to find new and unique recipes provided by the chosen API. Depending on the API, users will be able to search through different recipes based on personal needs. For example, they can search by recipe name, country of origin, main ingredient, etc. There will also be a section where users can view their favorite recipes, providing easy access to them. Finally, if a user doesn't know what they want to make, they can click the random recipe generator!  
+
+### App Evaluation
+
+<!-- This is taken from the brainstorming hackMD doc -->
+
+- **Category:** Food / Health / Fitness
+- **Mobile:** Rather than going through different websites to find a recipe for biriyani, you can find whatever you need in one app
+- **Story:** This app would allow chefs of varying expertise to try and cook new recipes. It would also allow users to track favorite recipes to refer back to at any time.
+- **Market:** Potential users for this app can be anyone wanting to improve their palate. Examples include, me, you, and even Gordon Ramsay!
+- **Habit:** The app could encourage users such as Paulina Ramos to browse and search for recipes on a daily basis, as well as plan their meals for the week and create a shopping list.
+- **Scope:** Difficulty 7/10 because the app would require a database of recipes, as well as a way for users to search and maybe filter them based on ingredients, cooking time, dietary restrictions. The scope would increase further if the app included user-generated content, such as allowing users to upload their own recipes or rate and review existing ones. It's like yelp - but for recipes!

+This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: An app that **will allow users to find new and unique recipes provided by the chosen API. Depending on the API, users will be able to search through different recipes based on personal needs. For example, they can search by recipe name, country of origin, main ingredient, etc. There will also be a section where users can view their favorite recipes, providing easy access to them. Finally, if a user doesn’t know what they want to make, they can click the random recipe generator!**
