## Summary

This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: An app that **will allow users to find new and unique recipes provided by the chosen API. Depending on the API, users will be able to search through different recipes based on personal needs. For example, they can search by recipe name, country of origin, main ingredient, etc. There will also be a section where users can view their favorite recipes, providing easy access to them. Finally, if a user doesn‚Äôt know what they want to make, they can click the random recipe generator!**
